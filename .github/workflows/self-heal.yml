            CI failed. Here is the Lighthouse report JSON:
            ```json
            ${{ steps.download-artifact.outputs['lhr-report/report.json'] }}
            ```
            And here are the last 200 lines of the build log:
            ```bash
            tail -n 200 $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/lhr/report.json
            ```
            Analyze both and output a unified-diff patch to fix the failure.
