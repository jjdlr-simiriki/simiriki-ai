# Simiriki AI‑Enabled Platform Plan

## Objective
Simiriki currently offers a landing page focused on automation, cybersecurity and generative AI for LATAM SMBs.  To stay ahead, Simiriki could evolve into a fully‑fledged AI platform.  This plan outlines how to build or extend Simiriki with modern web frameworks, Azure Databricks and agentic AI, using Python as the core language.

## Front‑end Architecture

### Choice of Framework

- **React** – Databricks highlights React as a natural choice for building interactive, polished web applications.  A Databricks Apps example pairs a React front‑end with the Mosaic AI Agent Framework to build a chatbot application【947768009940939†L195-L200】.  This demonstrates that React can handle real‑time interactions and smoothly call AI services.

- **Angular** – Angular/AngularJS can also be used to build single‑page apps (SPAs) that access Databricks data.  A CData tutorial shows how AngularJS combined with a Databricks connector can create SPAs with live Databricks data【496718178557390†L278-L283】.  In other words, either Angular or React is viable.  For a new project, React offers a larger ecosystem and easier integration with existing Databricks examples.

### Design Considerations

- Use a single framework (don’t mix Angular and React) to simplify state management.
- Build modular components: header, landing pages, dashboards and AI chat interfaces.
- Ensure responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
- Use secure authentication (OAuth/OpenID Connect) integrated with Azure AD.

## Azure Databricks as the Backend Platform

Azure Databricks provides a managed data lakehouse and AI environment.  Databricks Apps integrate natively with Databricks SQL, Unity Catalog, model serving and job orchestration【947768009940939†L211-L227】.  Hosting your application as a Databricks App removes the need for separate infrastructure and inherits Databricks’ security and compliance features.

### Mosaic AI Agent Framework

The Mosaic AI Agent Framework on Databricks helps developers create, deploy and manage AI agents.  It integrates with LangChain, LlamaIndex and other frameworks, leveraging Databricks features like Unity Catalog and tool‑calling【947768009940939†L231-L237】.  Once agents are configured, they can be deployed as model‑serving endpoints and called from your front‑end via REST【947768009940939†L286-L289】.

## Python AI and Agent Implementation

Python is the recommended language for authoring AI agents on Azure Databricks.  Microsoft’s guidance notes that you can build AI agents in Python using the Mosaic AI Agent Framework and third‑party libraries like LangGraph and LangChain; the requirements include Python 3.10+, the `databricks‑agents` and `mlflow` packages【464959779034253†L355-L372】.  Agents are wrapped with the MLflow `ResponsesAgent` interface to enable logging, tracing and deployment【464959779034253†L390-L437】.

### Development Workflow

1. **Develop the agent in a Databricks notebook** – Build a Python class implementing your business logic (e.g., summarising documents, predicting risks) and wrap it in a `ResponsesAgent` for deployment【464959779034253†L390-L437】.
2. **Register the model** – Use MLflow to log the agent, which captures the model signature and allows version control.
3. **Deploy as a serving endpoint** – Databricks model serving exposes the agent via REST, enabling your React front‑end to query it.
4. **Monitor and iterate** – Use Databricks’ built‑in evaluation and monitoring to refine the agent over time.

## Integration Plan

1. **Define use cases** – Identify the tasks your AI assistant should handle (e.g., summarising documents, generating reports, forecasting budgets).  Scope them into phases.
2. **Set up Databricks workspace** – Create or configure your Databricks workspace, enabling Databricks Apps and model serving.  Configure Unity Catalog for governance.
3. **Implement the front‑end** – Choose React (or Angular).  Build components for dashboards and an AI chat interface.  Use Axios or Fetch to call backend endpoints.
4. **Build AI agents** – Write Python agents using Mosaic AI.  Start with simple functions (document summarisation) and expand to multi‑agent systems.  Wrap with `ResponsesAgent` for deployment【464959779034253†L390-L437】.
5. **Deploy and connect** – Deploy agents as model‑serving endpoints.  Connect the front‑end to these endpoints via HTTP calls.  Ensure proper authentication and error handling.
6. **Testing and monitoring** – Test the app end‑to‑end.  Use Databricks’ monitoring tools to track latency, usage and model performance.
7. **Iterate and expand** – Add new agents, automate workflows (e.g., approvals, alerts) and integrate additional data sources (Power Automate flows, ERP systems).

## Future Roadmap

- **Advanced analytics** – Use Databricks SQL and Unity Catalog to build dashboards and allow natural‑language queries.
- **Multi‑agent orchestration** – Implement multi‑agent systems for complex tasks, drawing on examples from Databricks and LangChain.
- **Edge deployment** – For offline scenarios, explore deploying lightweight models to local devices or containers.
- **Security and compliance** – Align with ISO 27001 and SOC 2 standards; enforce least‑privilege and zero‑trust principles.

## Conclusion

Upgrading Simiriki from a static landing page to a fully interactive AI platform is achievable with today’s tools.  A React or Angular front‑end communicates with Python‑based AI agents hosted on Azure Databricks.  Databricks Apps provide secure hosting and deep integration with the data platform, while the Mosaic AI Agent Framework and MLflow simplify building and deploying agents.  By following this plan, you can deliver an intelligent, scalable platform that keeps your clients ahead of the curve.
